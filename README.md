# House_Price_Predication

This challenge asks us to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa, based on a set of information provided, such as size, neighborhood, condition, etc.

A real estate agent might be able to do this based on intuition and experience, but a computer – lacking this ability and knowledge – might just accomplish the same. This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.
